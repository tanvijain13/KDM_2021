One thing to understand is that when Kansas City embraced the postwar gospel of freeways (more of them, per capita, than any other major U.S. city), free parking (oceans of it), and tax-subsidized malls and big box stores, it was turning its back on its own biggest strengths. And it wasn't alone: nearly every city did this to some extent in the second half of the twentieth century. Kansas City proper encapsulates the resulting problems more than many cities because of its annexation practices, which brought huge tracts of suburban land into city limits.
