Health officials “remain concerned about variants arising throughout the U.S., so this means prevention measures and widespread testing are that much more crucial to move us beyond COVID-19,” Dr. Randall Williams, director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said in announcing the testing events.

Anyone experiencing COVID-19 symptoms should be tested, as well as anyone who has had significant contact with someone with confirmed COVID-19, health officials said.

Symptoms listed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention include fever or chills, a cough, fatigue, a new loss of taste or smell, muscle or body aches and diarrhea. They can occur anywhere from two to 14 days after being exposed to the virus.

A COVID-19 test will only reveal if you are infected at the time of the test.
