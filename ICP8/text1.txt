Kansas will move to the next two phases of its COVID-19 vaccination rollout next week, opening up shots to younger adults with medical risks like asthma and essential workers such as bank tellers.

Gov. Laura Kelly said Monday that Kansas will begin phases three and four simultaneously on March 22 and that the state will meet President Joe Bidenâ€™s deadline to make every adult eligible by May 1.

The announcement marks an acceleration in the vaccination campaign and comes as Kelly is under pressure from lawmakers to let counties set their own phases.
